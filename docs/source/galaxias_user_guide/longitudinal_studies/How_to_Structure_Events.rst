How to Structure Your Events file
======================================

Structuring an events file to comply with the Darwin Core standard may take a bit of time, but it is 
well worth the effort, as this type of file captures events over time, which is invaluable to researchers 
and decision makers alike!  The main information we need to capture in the events are:

- when the visit happened (date)
- where the event took place (locality, other)
- what type of event was it (survey, transect, etc.)
- how you took the measurements (observation, etc.)
- name of event (i.e. BioBlitz, bird survey etc.)

.. note:: Occurrences
    an events file ALWAYS has to have an associated occurrence file with it, so we are assuming that 
    you have this as well.

If you would prefer to follow along using our example datasets, go to the `events homepage <index.html>`_.

To get started, choose one of the following pages:

- `set_datetime <set_datetime.html>`_
- `set_events <set_events.html>`_
