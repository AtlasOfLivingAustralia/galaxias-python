        <introduction>This section can include any methods you like, but should, at minimum, give a simple description of how the data were collected. To link to a publication with more complete information, add a level-2 heading called `Reference Publication` and add the citation to your paper. 
 If applicable, you can also choose to add information on data processing that are specific to this version of your dataset. This may include information on whether data on threatened species have been removed, or spatial data have been generalised (i.e. set to a lower spatial precision than the source dataset).</introduction>
