Independent Observations
==========================

Independent observations are the most basic type of Darwin Core Archive.  
You have independent observations if the observations are not linked to each 
other.  They may be linked if you have been doing observations in the same 
place over time, for example.  If you suspect your observations may be linked, 
go to `Longitudinal Studies <longitudinal_studies.html>`_.

For these types of archives, you will need to ensure your data and metadata both 
comply with the Darwin Core standard.  This page is for data, and this one is for 
metadata.
