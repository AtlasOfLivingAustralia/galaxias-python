What are Darwin Core Archives?
--------------------------------------

`Darwin Core Archives <https://ipt.gbif.org/manual/en/ipt/latest/dwca-guide#what-is-darwin-core-archive-dwc-a>`_ 
are the format in which the `Atlas of Living Australia <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_ accepts and publishes biodiversity 
data.  Each archive contains:

- **Data:** This is the data you (and/or others) have collected.  This can include, but is not 
limited to: observations, data on longitudinal studies, and environmental data.
- **Metadata:** This is information about the data.  This can include, but is not limited to: 
who collected the data, what methods were used to collect the data, and the license you would like 
attributed to your data.
- **Description of DwCA**: Each archive contains a file that describes how the data and the metadata 
are linked.

What type of data do I have?
---------------------------------

We currently support two types of archives, with extensions coming in the future.
