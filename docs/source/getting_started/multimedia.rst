Multimedia in an Archive
==========================

When submitting your data to the ALA, sometimes you will have multimedia associated with your occurrence records, 
be it images, sounds or videos.  If you wish to include this kind of data, both Darwin Core Archives and EventCore 
Archives have the option to add what's called a ``multimedia`` extension.  This is a ``csv`` file that associates each 
of your multimedia files with an occurrence, or in the case of an EventCore, also an event.  More details are in 
the relevant sections of the galaxias user guide.
