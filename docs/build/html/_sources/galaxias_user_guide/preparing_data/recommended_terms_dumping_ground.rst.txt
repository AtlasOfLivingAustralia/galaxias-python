Other Recommended Terms
====================================

Additional Location information
-----------------------------------

Sometimes, additional location information is necessary, especially if you are using a GPS, or if you are 
looking at a specific site and want to provide extra information.  In these cases, you can include the 
following terms, which will also help validate your coordinates:

``coordinatePrecision`` : how precise the device with which you measure your occurrence is

``country`` : country in which occurrences were seen

``locality`` : locality in which occurrences were seen

``stateProvince`` : state or province in which occurrences were seen


Extra occurrence information
--------------------------------

This information is useful in X, but is also especially useful in EventCore.

``individualCount`` : number of individuals present

``occurrenceStatus`` : PRESENT / ABSENT

``recordedBy`` : who recorded the occurrence
