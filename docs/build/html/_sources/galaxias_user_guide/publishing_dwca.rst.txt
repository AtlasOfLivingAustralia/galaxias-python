Validating the DwCA against GBIF 
================================

After successfully building and validating your archive, now you can
publish your data to the ALA!  If you are ok with your data being in 
the public space, you can create a Github issue by using the ``submit_archive()`` 
function:

.. prompt:: Python

    >>> my_dwca.submit_archive()

If, you are not entirely comfortable with this, and/or your 
data contains information on sensitive species, send us your file 
and a brief description to  
`our support queue <mailto:support@ala.org.au>`_.
