**galaxias** is a streamlined workflow and package designed to give users the ability to efficiently  
prepare their data for submission to the living atlases in the form of Darwin Core Archives (DwCAs) 
while ensuring the users still have control and autonomy with their data.  ``galaxias`` was built 
and is maintained by the `Science & Decision Support Team <https://labs.ala.org.au/>`_ at the 
`Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) <https://www.ala.org.au/>`_.

``galaxias`` enables users to enrich their data while ensuring that it aligns with the 
`‘Darwin Core’ <https://dwc.tdwg.org/>`_ data standard, as well as the standards and requirements of 
their chosen living atlas.  

The package is named for the freshwater fish of the same name (*galaxias ????*), a widely-distributed 
endemic Australian species.  The logo was designed by `Ian Brennan <http://www.iangbrennan.org/>`_.
